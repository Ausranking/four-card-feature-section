## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I have learned the concept of Css Flexbox and absolute positioining and CSS Grid
ensuring that every content of the page is contained by a landmark.

### Continued development

Taking up this chalenge at first was quite scary because of my little knowledge of CSS grid presently.
But while on this, i appreciated coding more for being able to come up with this.
I havn't made the mobile view as I'm yet to learn better about media querries.
